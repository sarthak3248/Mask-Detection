# Mask-Detection


Hi Everyone,

The Follwing project uses various Concepts of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in order to make Mask Detection on people's face.

Due to a Worldwide Pandemic there is a need and responsibilty of everyone to wear Mask and Sanitize their Hands and surrounding and follow the neccessary precautions to be take in order to be safe from the virus.

This causes a need to make a device or program that can help the authorities to ensure that people have put Mask on their face to ensure the safety of others and themselves.

Prime motive include implementation of various concept of ML and Deep Learning such as Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN).

You can contribute in making the changes to the code that may increase the feasibilty and accuracy of the project.

Thank You!
